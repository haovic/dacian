Environment:
    There's a Dockerfile that includes any dependencies needed to build.
    VSCode can also run inside this container with the Remote Container extension.
    > Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...

    The following packages are required to build:
        libgflags-dev 
        libleveldb-dev 
        libprotobuf-dev 
        libprotoc-dev 
        libssl-dev 

 
Building:
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir build-brpc && cd build-brpc && cmake ../brpc && make && make install
    mkdir build-braft && cd build-braft && cmake ../braft && make && make install
    mkdir build-kv && cd build-kv && cmake ../kv && make && make install

Running the server:
    cd kv && ./run_server.sh

Running the client:
    cd kv && ./run_client.sh

Additional flags can be found at the top of ./run_server and ./run_client
including the ability to change consistency of get requests.
